## Description

The Newsletter Committee puts together a monthly newsletter intended for the graduate students. The newsletter will inform students about current news and upcoming events while also providing general information about the graduate student experience. The chairs are responsible for coordinating the newsletter; they may delegate any amount of writing, photography, editing, layout, distribution, and any other tasks. The finished newsletter is distributed to graduate students, postdocs, and faculty; copies for undergraduates are made available in Muhly Lounge, and the file will be available on the department web page.
