# Title:
The Topological Data Analysis Pipeline
# Abstract:
As the amount of data collected has increased in recent years, new methods for understanding data have been sought. One such method, Topological Data Analysis, or TDA, studies data and draws conclusions using the shape of the data set. In this talk, we will walk through the TDA pipeline in the one parameter case to illustrate the process of taking a data set and transforming it to have a geometric shape. We will then apply persistent homology in order to draw a conclusion about the data. To conclude, we will look at applications of TDA as well as briefly discuss the multiparameter setting.
