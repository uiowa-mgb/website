## Title:
Constructing the Jones polynomial to save the world.

## Abstract:

DNA are molecules made long chains of four nucleobases: cytosine, guanine, adenine, and thymine. We find ourselves working at the CDC at the outbreak of the zombie apocalypse. We've been able to image the DNA of the "Z" virus and found that the DNA is knotted. We can use this fact to construct an anti-virus, the "mirror" of the virus. In this activity we build a tool, the Jones polynomial, to check our work and save the world.
