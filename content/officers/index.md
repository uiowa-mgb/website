## Heartland Chair

The [Heartland Partnership](/heartland/) is an undergraduate-focused speaking series organized by a collection of schools in the Midwest. Heartland visits serve to better integrate faculty and graduate students here at Iowa with those at the Heartland Schools. By offering undergraduates with exposure to graduate topics in mathematics, we hope to excite them about careers in math. Our graduate students also benefit from the practice of giving talks and forming connections with professors and students at these schools.

The Heartland Chair will find interested graduate speakers, and maintain a list of [talks on offer](/heartland/talks_on_offer/2024_2025/). They will coordinate with faculty at partner institutions to organize speaking sessions, typically as part of the undergraduate math club.
