## GAUSS and DRP Co-Chairs

GAUSS (Graduate and Undergraduate Student Seminar) is a weekly lecture series by, for, and catering to the interests of mathematics graduate students and undergraduate mathematics majors.
The chairs of the committee shall organize a schedule of weekly colloquia fitting these requirements. Choice of speakers and topics is at the discretion of the chairs, but should be informed by the desires of students. GAUSS talks shall be publicized via email to math faculty, graduate students, and undergraduates; the seminars shall also be listed in the department's weekly schedule of talks.

The Iowa DRP (Directed Reading Program) is "an initiative to pair undergraduate students with graduate student mentors to work on independent study projects in the field of mathematics." The chairs of the comittee will find, pair, and organize undergraduate students and graduate mentors with similar interests.

## Heartland Chair

The [Heartland Partnership](/heartland/) is an undergraduate-focused speaking series organized by a collection of schools in the Midwest. Heartland visits serve to better integrate faculty and graduate students here at Iowa with those at the Heartland Schools. By offering undergraduates with exposure to graduate topics in mathematics, we hope to excite them about careers in math. Our graduate students also benefit from the practice of giving talks and forming connections with professors and students at these schools.

The Heartland Chair will find interested graduate speakers, and maintain a list of [talks on offer](/heartland/talks_on_offer/2024_2025/). They will coordinate with faculty at partner institutions to organize speaking sessions, typically as part of the undergraduate math club.
