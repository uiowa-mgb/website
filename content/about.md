The Math Graduate Board (MGB) exists to provide a forum for departmental discourse, to organize departmental events, and to generally enrich the graduate mathematics experience at the University of Iowa.  It is an official university student organization established and led entirely by math graduate students.  The board sponsors several social events, including the semiannual Mathematics Picnic.  We organize the Graduate and Undergraduate Student Seminar (GAUSS).  We publish the Iowa Sum-Times, a graduate student newsletter.  Our constitution is available here.  You can contact us by emailing our chair, Amrei Oswald.

The MGB general meetings are held monthly in the Muhly Lounge.  Meeting minutes are available shortly after.

See our calendar for upcoming GAUSS talks.  GAUSS is held weekly. In addition, for those involved in the Directed Reading Program, information and meetings regarding the program can be found here.

MGB has resources for grad students (CV templates, etc.) available on OrgSync, as well as ICON.  If you need help registering for OrgSync, email the webmaster.
