# Statement of Purpose

The Math Graduate Board (MGB) exists to provide a forum for departmental discourse, to organize departmental events, and to generally enrich the graduate mathematics experience at the University of Iowa.  It is an official university student organization established and led entirely by math graduate students.
The MGB general meetings are held monthly in the Muhly Lounge.  Meeting minutes are available shortly after.

The most recent constitution can be found [here](https://uiowa.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/math-graduate-board-mgb/documents/view/2305953)
