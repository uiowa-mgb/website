Exciting News: Introducing the UIowa Beamer Theme!

Thanks to the contributions of Alex Polenberg and Ethan Rooke the initial
release of this beamer theme is ready for public consumption! This theme has
been designed with the University of Iowa community in mind, and we are thrilled
to share it with you.

Here are the key features of the UIowa Beamer theme:

1. Iowa Branding: The theme incorporates the official University of Iowa
   colors and logo, ensuring that your presentation aligns with the
   university's visual identity. This consistency reinforces your affiliation
   with UIowa and adds a professional touch to your work. Embrace the power of
   conformity!

1. Easy-to-Use: We understand that time is precious, so we have designed the
   Beamer theme to be user-friendly. With an overleaf template ready to go, if
   you already know how to use beamer your presentations can become on-brand
   masterpieces in seconds. Hail corporate.

During its development, the UIowa Beamer theme proved its mettle by being used
to successfully defend a thesis! However, we understand that there may still be
some undiscovered issues or stylistic oversights lurking in the shadows. If you
happen to stumble upon anything that doesn't look quite right, we encourage you
to unleash your feedback and open an issue on our  [GitHub
page](https://github.com/uiowa-mgb/uiowa-beamer/issues). Together, let's make
this theme even more ok!

you too can become a walking billboard for your alma mater.
