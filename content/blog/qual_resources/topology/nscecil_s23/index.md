## Qual Prep Course Resource

One of our graduate students [Nicholas Cecil](https://math.uiowa.edu/people/nicholas-cecil) has supplied the materials he used when he taught the qual prep course in summer 2023. On the problems list, he marked the questions that he thought were beyond the scope of the qual with an asterisk.  They are still good questions that are about qual material, but just aren't something someone needs to look at on the first pass. He also is happy for you to reach out to him for additional help and insights.
