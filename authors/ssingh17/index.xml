      <title>Thoughts on qualifying exams</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, you&amp;rsquo;re gearing up for your Qualification Exams, but before you begin, I&amp;rsquo;d like to share a few thoughts about the exams and the preparation. This has less to do with the course material and more to do with the &lt;em&gt;&amp;rsquo;exam&amp;rsquo;&lt;/em&gt; aspect of it. It is a rather long rant about &lt;em&gt;&amp;lsquo;preparation&amp;rsquo;&lt;/em&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m sure most of us are aware of the things listed below. You may even find it boring but I recommend that you read it. It never hurts to remind ourselves of the easier things that we take for granted.
There&amp;rsquo;s no one-size-fits-all preparation strategy. We all learn differently and at our own pace. However, there are general ideas that can streamline your preparation. Even if you don&amp;rsquo;t find anything helpful here, this should at least encourage you to take a step back and think about &lt;em&gt;&amp;lsquo;how to prepare&amp;rsquo;&lt;/em&gt; before you start the prep. It is good to have a plan so that you use your time more effectively.
The qualifying exams are designed to test your understanding of the material covered in the 5000-level courses. Therefore, it won&amp;rsquo;t be enough to just know the material if you do not know how to apply it. &lt;em&gt;Memorizing has its place but cannot be a substitute for understanding.&lt;/em&gt; Thus, I would like to draw attention to the following aspects of the exams. This should, hopefully, guide your preparation better.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
