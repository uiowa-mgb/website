In general this takes 4 steps.\nInstall a Tex distribution. This is what supplies LaTeX and all packages associated with it. We will be installing TeX Live. Install Perl. Perl is old person python, LaTeX packages and tools like to use it. Installing it will help everything run seamlessly. Install Visual Studio Code Install and configure extensions for Visual Studio Code Below there are system specific installation instructions for Windows, macOS, and Linux.\nWindows # 1. TeX Live # To do this you have to download and run an installer. Windows will possibly tell you that it prevented installation to protect you. You can enable installation by clicking on details then install anyway.\nWhen running the installer there are three options you should change:\nDefault paper size: set this to letter, you live in the US you will always be printing on letter paper. Install for all users: uncheck this, you are probably the only person who uses your computer anyway. It is probably unchecked to begin with. Install TeXworks front end: uncheck this, we will be installing vscode as our front end. The official installer can be found here: https://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/install-tl-windows.exe\nThis will take a while to install: on a test machine it took approximately 1.5 hours. You can continue on to the next steps while this is installing.\n2. Perl # We will install strawberry perl. Download and run the system installer. Just like with TeX Live windows will warn you about the installation. Unlike TeX Live it will prompt you for admin privileges as it will be system-wide installation.\n3. Visual Studio Code # Install from this link, then follow the instructions for configuring Visual Studio Code.\nMacOS # These instructions are as complete as I, a filthy poor person with no macOS machine at their disposal, could make them. If you run into problems feel free to open an issue.\n1. TeX Live # There is an installer called MacTeX, instructions for installing it can be found here. This installer will install a couple of programs along side TeXlive. If you wish to not install some of them there is a customize button on the final page before clicking install which will let you select which to install.\nTeX Live Utility: you want this. It lets you manage TeX Live. TeXShop: is a LaTeX editor made for macOS. This is redundant if you wish to install vscode. It does look pretty nice tho. LaTeXiT: lets you write TeX snippets and include them in any document BibDesk: A bibliography manager 2. Perl # MacOS ships with Perl, you don\u0026rsquo;t have to do anything!\n3. Visual Studio Code # Install from this link, then follow the instructions for configuring Visual Studio Code.\nLinux # These instructions will be rather brief. There are too many Linux distributions to worry about. I\u0026rsquo;m assuming you know how to handle yourself well enough. If someone has good distro agnostic install instructions feel free to open a PR.\n1. TeX Live # Install TeX live through your distros package manager. For example if your distro uses apt:\n# apt-get install texlive-full 2. Perl # Install Perl through your package manager (you almost surely have it installed already). For example if your distro uses pacman:\n# pacman -S perl 3. Visual Studio Code # Install VS code through your package mana-\u0026hellip; Ok so, unfortunately vs code is not open source!\nCode is a cross-platform text editor developed by Microsoft, built on the Electron framework. Visual Studio Code is a binary distribution of the MIT-licensed Code - OSS repository, with Microsoft specific customizations and released under a proprietary license. For details on the mixed licensing, see this GitHub comment. There is also a community-driven, MIT-licensed binary release called VSCodium with telemetry disabled by default.\nThe Arch Wiki\nSo I guess\u0026hellip; Install code, vs-codium, or vs-code through your distros package manager. See the arch wiki for more details, all hail the arch wiki.\n4. Configure Visual Studio Code # Depending on your choice for the previous step how you actually do this configuring will change. The arch wiki (praise be) details how to install extensions if you decided to not use the proprietary version of Visual Studio Code. With that in mind configure vs-code\nConfigure Visual Studio Code # Install the following extensions\nLaTeX Workshop. This does most of the latex stuff LaTeX Utilities. This adds some more latex stuff Code Spell Checker. This will let you tune the spell checker Start a new project # Congratulations you now have all the tools and a shiny new editor to write LaTeX documents! The simplest way to get up and running would be to copy our LaTeX template. If you open the main.tex file in vscode it should be automatically configured to give a nice experience out of the box. If something is not clear please feel free to ask a question by opening an issue.\n","date":"13 November 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/resources/latex_guide/","section":"Resources","summary":"This guide will walk you through how to get a LaTeX environment setup on your computer.

This usually consists of two University of Iowa graduate students, one speaker and one support, who travel to a Heartland school and give a math talk. The subject area and level of these talks vary, and can be negotiated. Such talks often serve as the school\u0026rsquo;s math club talk. After the talk is over, many schools like to hold a short Q\u0026amp;A about what life is like as a graduate student at the University of Iowa.\nVisits are arranged by the Heartland Liaison, a new MGB officer position, under the supervision of Professor Vic Camilo. This officer is elected annually; the current information may always be found on the Officers page.\nWho benefits from Heartland visits? # Heartland visits serve to better integrate faculty and graduate students here at Iowa with those at the Heartland Schools. Heartland students get a chance to learn about graduate school in mathematics and to form connections with current Mathematics graduate students, which we hope will excite them about math. Our graduate students also benefit from the practice of giving a talk and also forming connections with professors and students at the schools.\nFurther Details # To view a list of participating Heartland schools, please visit our Schools page.\nTo view a sampling of prior Heartland student visits, look over our Past Visits page.\nIf you would like to contact any school directly, visit our Contacts page. You may also contact the Heartland Liaison, who can arrange a visit for you, give you more information about the program, or answer any further questions.\n","date":"1 January 0001","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/heartland/","section":"Heartland","summary":"General Information # What is the Heartland Partnership? # The Heartland Partnership is a collection of schools in the Midwest that have come together in order to help each other.","title":"Heartland","type":"Heartland"},{"content":" School Name City Location Distance/Drive Time Bradley Peoria, IL 152 miles / 2 ~h 30 ~m Central College Pella, IA 98 miles / 2 ~h Clarke College Dubuque, IA 84 miles / 1 ~h 45 ~m Coe College Cedar Rapids, IA 28 miles / 30 ~m Cornell College Mount Vernon, IA 22 miles / 30 ~m Grinnell Grinnell, IA 67 miles / 1 ~h 15 ~m Loras College Mount Vernon, IA 22 miles / 30m Luther College Decorah, IA 136 miles / 3h St. Ambrose Davenport, IA 54 miles / 1h Simpson College Indianola, IA 130 miles / 2 ~h 10 ~m Truman State Kirksville, MO 164 miles / 3h 15 ~m UW Eau Claire Eau Claire, WI 283 miles / 5 ~h 45 ~m UW La Crosse La Crosse, WI 186 miles / 4h 30 ~m Wartburg College Waverly, IA 102 miles / 1 ~h 45 ~m ","date":"1 January 0001","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/heartland/schools/","section":"Heartland","summary":"School Name City Location Distance/Drive Time Bradley Peoria, IL 152 miles / 2 ~h 30 ~m Central College Pella, IA 98 miles / 2 ~h Clarke College Dubuque, IA 84 miles / 1 ~h 45 ~m Coe College Cedar Rapids, IA 28 miles / 30 ~m Cornell College Mount Vernon, IA 22 miles / 30 ~m Grinnell Grinnell, IA 67 miles / 1 ~h 15 ~m Loras College Mount Vernon, IA 22 miles / 30m Luther College Decorah, IA 136 miles / 3h St.","title":"Heartland Schools","type":"Heartland"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/index/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"index","type":"tags"},{"content":" Chair # The Chair is responsible for planning and running the monthly MGB meetings as well as any other open meetings the Chair shall call.

This has less to do with the course material and more to do with the \u0026rsquo;exam\u0026rsquo; aspect of it. It is a rather long rant about \u0026lsquo;preparation\u0026rsquo;. I\u0026rsquo;m sure most of us are aware of the things listed below. You may even find it boring but I recommend that you read it. It never hurts to remind ourselves of the easier things that we take for granted. There\u0026rsquo;s no one-size-fits-all preparation strategy. We all learn differently and at our own pace. However, there are general ideas that can streamline your preparation. Even if you don\u0026rsquo;t find anything helpful here, this should at least encourage you to take a step back and think about \u0026lsquo;how to prepare\u0026rsquo; before you start the prep. It is good to have a plan so that you use your time more effectively. The qualifying exams are designed to test your understanding of the material covered in the 5000-level courses. Therefore, it won\u0026rsquo;t be enough to just know the material if you do not know how to apply it. Memorizing has its place but cannot be a substitute for understanding. Thus, I would like to draw attention to the following aspects of the exams. This should, hopefully, guide your preparation better.\nProblem-solving # Throughout Qual Prep, you\u0026rsquo;ll solve a lot of problems. The goal isn\u0026rsquo;t to do a large number of problems and hope that some of them show up in the actual exam. Instead, through practice, develop habits that\u0026rsquo;ll help you avoid common mistakes. Numerous books and articles have been written on problem-solving. The resources are endless. You most definitely have methods of your own. That being said, here is what a generic approach should look like:\nMake sure you understand the problem. On the face of it, this sounds like the most obvious advice one can give you. However, on a timed exam it is not good to have wasted 10 minutes on a problem only to realize that you misunderstood the problem. Are you supposed to provide a proof or an example/counterexample? Try rephrasing the problem in your own words or converting the problem statement from words to symbols/notation. Maybe drawing a picture helps. Can you think of a simpler case or an example where you can easily verify the problem statement? Come up with a plan. Once you\u0026rsquo;ve identified what to do, it is time to devise the master plan. Here are a few questions that should help you in the process. Have you seen a similar problem before? Do the assumptions the problem makes relate to some well-known results? Maybe what you\u0026rsquo;re supposed to conclude is a consequence of a well-known result. What\u0026rsquo;s a better method to use here? For example, if you want to directly prove the statement or its contrapositive; maybe proof by contradiction works better here, etc. You should have a convincing plan before you devote a serious amount of time to a particular problem. Execution/Verification. There is nothing much to be said here. You have your outline and it is only a matter of filling in the details. Revise your plan as you go, if needed. The planning step may sound trivial to you. It might feel like it is \u0026ldquo;not worth the time\u0026rdquo;. However, you should realize that it isn\u0026rsquo;t simply helping you answer the question but also helping you organize your thoughts. It is easy to get lost in the details while solving a problem. Clarity of your proofs matters just as much as correctness and an outline will make your writing more coherent. You might be on the other extreme. You might think \u0026lsquo;planning\u0026rsquo; is easier said than done. Looking at the problem, if you don\u0026rsquo;t even know where to start, then all you need is some practice. Here are a few things to try. You should look at solved problems and think about how you\u0026rsquo;d solve them during an exam. While studying from your course notes, you should write a summary of individual sections. Try listing out key ideas and how they relate to each other.\nWhen working with friends, before presenting a detailed answer to a problem, you should give a \u0026ldquo;sketch\u0026rdquo; or a strategy. Explain how you would approach this particular problem during an exam.\nWhile practicing, you will revisit the problems you\u0026rsquo;ve already solved. If you get stuck, you should only look at the sketch from before and see if you can fill in the details.\nAlthough problem-solving is the most important aspect of the exams, we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t get too focused on it. These are timed exams and being prepared doesn\u0026rsquo;t simply mean having mastered the subject. Apart from problem-solving skills, you also need to learn how to manage your time and expectations.\nManaging time and expectations # During the exam, say, you\u0026rsquo;ve spent 15 minutes on a problem but you\u0026rsquo;re nowhere close to the solution. You keep going because it feels like you have a better chance of solving this problem than starting a new one from scratch. Much later you realize that you\u0026rsquo;re going nowhere with the problem and should have switched to a different one sooner. Or take the other extreme case where you spend only a few minutes on each problem but don\u0026rsquo;t have a solution to any of the problems. I wish there was a golden rule about the least amount of time to spend on a problem and when to move on. It varies from person to person and problem to problem. Over the summer (or winter, whenever you\u0026rsquo;re preparing for the exam) while practicing, you should be mindful about this and find your comfort zone. Experiment with solving problems under time constraints, and find your rythm.\nI should end this note with an important aspect of the preparation which is not entirely exam related.\nCollaboration # Remember, you\u0026rsquo;re not alone. You\u0026rsquo;re all having a similar experience. There is no reason why you should do it alone. I encourage you to work with others. Learning with/from others is only going to make the process easier and faster. Together, you\u0026rsquo;ll thrive!\nThese are just some of my thoughts. Your ideas might be better than the ones listed here and you should not shy away from sharing them with others. Good luck and have fun!\nQuestion sets # Algebra Question Sets From Summer 2023 Analysis Question Set From Summer 2022 Prep Sheet From Summer 2022 Topology Question Sets From Summer 2023 PDE Question Sets From Summer 2023 Numerical Analysis Question Sets From Summer 2023 ","date":"1 January 0001","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/qual_resources/general/","section":"The MGB Blog","summary":"So, you\u0026rsquo;re gearing up for your Qualification Exams, but before you begin, I\u0026rsquo;d like to share a few thoughts about the exams and the preparation.
